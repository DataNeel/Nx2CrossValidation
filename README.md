The included python script runs Nx2 fold Cross Validation on multiple binary classifiers in parallel. The code uses the area under a ROC curve to choose the best model and will downsample to specified ratios as well. Significance testing is also provided in a separate function.

Burez and Van den Poel (2009) was the main source cited when writing this code.
